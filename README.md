# Power-of-Data-Transformation-in-Model-Building.

The Power of Data Transformation using Response Rate Calculation, in Model Building, Explained using a simple data set.

The Problem statment is to clasify whether the person is Male or Female.

# Data Structure

year    - number/integer

age	    - number/integer -- the Age is in Months

height	- number/integer -- the height in Inches

weight	- number/integer -- the weight in pounds

target  - factor         -- M- Male, F- Female

Observation:

All though the data set looks simple and small, neither the Statistical models nor the Advanced Machine learning models even the Ensambling methods are failng to give us more than 65% of accuracy. For any models.

If the Model is build using the raw data, the model is not improving more than 65% of Accuracy.

After transformation, just the Statistical model Logistic Regression itself gives 98% Accuracy
and SVM out performed it by giving 100% prediction result.
